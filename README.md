# Mastering Microservices with Java 9 - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering Microservices with Java 9 - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-microservices-java-9-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787281448), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Microservices are the next big thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain applications. It not only makes app development easier, but also offers great flexibility to utilize various resources optimally. If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the microservices architecture, then this is the book for you!

Starting off by understanding the core concepts and framework, you will then focus on the high-level design of large software projects. You will gradually move on to setting up the development environment and configuring it before implementing continuous integration to deploy your microservice architecture. Using Spring security, you will secure microservices and test them effectively using REST Java clients and other tools like RxJava 2.0. We'll show you the best patterns, practices and common principals of microservice design and you'll learn to troubleshoot and debug the issues faced during development. We'll show you how to design and implement reactive microservices. Finally, weâ€™ll show you how to migrate a monolithic application to microservices based application.

By the end of the book, you will know how to build smaller, lighter, and faster services that can be implemented easily in a production environment.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"

```

For this book, you can use any operating system (Linux, Windows, or Mac) with a minimum of 2 GB RAM. You will also require NetBeans with Java, Maven, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Eureka Server, Docker, and a CI/CD application. For Docker containers, you may need a separate VM or a cloud host with preferably 16 GB or more of RAM.
